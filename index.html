<h3 class=articleTitle>LSC No Longer a Social Area</h3>
<p>The LSC in Palmers Campus is now no longer a social area as the college now only allows it's use as a quiet revision room. The College expects everyone that used LSC previously to move over to the garden room, while offering no answer as to what the people that use the green room should do. We are yet to find out how this will impact the students at the college but I'm sure it will be interesting.</p>
