<h3>Student CPD Day</h3>
<p>Next Wednesday (12/02/2020) is the next Student CPD Day.<br>Firstly, thank you for your feedback from the recent questionnaire. We have acted upon this, therefore while there are still some fantastic external providers coming in for a number of workshops (as you will see on the menu when up on the VLE) you will also have the opportunity to attend revision sessions, complete home study and have a 1:1 with your teacher if you have recently completed your year 2 mock exam.</p>
