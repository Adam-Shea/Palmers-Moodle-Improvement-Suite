<h3>Post CPD Pre Holiday</h3>
<p>We survived CPD day! What did you think? Was it poorly planned or did everything run smoothly for you? Please note that Friday the 14th is a teacher CPD day and therefore the college will not be open for students. Enjoy your day off! Make sure to look after yourself because you are important.<br><br>The week starting the 17th is half term which means college will be closed to students. Make sure to have a great week off and to have as much fun as you can. Maybe try to work on some projects you've been holding off?</p>
